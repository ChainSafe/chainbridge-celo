# ðŸŒ‰ <b> Overview </b>

## Summary

An alternative implementation of ChainBridge which supports bridging Celo chains. It includes additional proving mechanisms to provide initial security.

A bridge contract on each chain forms either side of a bridge. Handler contracts allow for customizable behavior upon receiving transactions to and from the bridge. For example locking up an asset on one side and minting a new one on the other. Its highly customizable - you can deploy a handler contract to perform any action you like.

In its current state ChainBridge-Celo operates under a trusted federation model. Deposit events on one chain are detected by a trusted set of off-chain relayers who await finality, submit events to the other chain and vote on submissions to reach acceptance triggering the appropriate handler.
